                        li You know how to play &ldquo;Poetry for Neanderthals&rdquo; and you have your two teams Mad and Glad with Team Mad to start (as shown by the team names down there).
                        li Choose (up top) how hard the game will be.
                        li Pass this to the first one to play, call them Groc for this guide.
                        li To start their turn, Groc click GO or the blank card. This will show the first card, start the clock, and GO will change to SKIP.
                        li To skip the card or if Groc screws up, they must click SKIP (and lose a point). If Groc's team gets the top word (marked 1) and Groc wants to move on, click the white part of the card for one point. If Groc's team gets the long word (marked 3), click the red part of the card for three points. In each case, the words (for this turn) show up in the lists at the foot of the page.
                        li Once time's up, the score is summed and Groc should pass to the next team.
                        li TIP: If Groc made an oops and clicked wrong, he can fix his team's score with the small up and down spikes.

                p To be clear: I, the one who made this web app, have no ties to &ldquo;Exploding Kittens&rdquo;, I just like &ldquo;Poetry for Neanderthals&rdquo;. I do not mean to hurt the real game or its pack of more cards. Go #[a(href='https://www.explodingkittens.com/collections/poetry-for-neanderthals', target='_blank') buy the game] if you don't have it yet! While they for sure share some terms, most of the real game's words are not in this deck (lean more #[a(href='', target='_blank') here]) and, as well, it is worth a lot that one can hold the real game's cards in one's hands.

                p These cards are made with &ldquo;LADEC&rdquo;. If you like words and how we learn to use them, read their great work: <br>#[span.citation Gagn&eacute;, C.L., Spalding, T.L. & Schmidtke, D. LADEC: The Large Database of English Compounds.
